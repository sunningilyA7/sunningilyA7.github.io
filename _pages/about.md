<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hello, my name is Bian Sun. I recently graduated from Carnegie Mellon University with a master's degree in Information Systems Management, specializing in Business Intelligence and Data Analytics. I earned my bachelor's degree from Zhongnan University of Economics and Law, and my first master's degree in Statistics from Wuhan University.

I have nearly four years of professional experience in Tech area, including roles as a Data Analyst at Tencent Weishi and a Senior Data Analyst in the social content e-commerce company DeWu. Additionally, I possess a strong background in finance quant, having passed the CFA/FRM Level 1 exam and studied financial engineering and cryptocurrency investments extensively.

Technically, I'm proficient in Python Java and SQL, skilled in model optimization, large scale computing, machine/deep learning, data modeling, ETL processes, data visualization, and familiar with cloud platforms such as Microsoft Azure and AWS SageMaker. In past projects, I was responsible for building data, machine pipelines that could support large-scale calculation and computing, processing mass data, analyzing commodity/product hedging strategies, and searching value volatility, translating data-driven insights into actionable business and computing resources strategies.

Personally, I am creative and highly curious, passionate about using data to drive effective decision-making and committed to providing efficient and precise solutions. I am particularly interested in emerging technologies such as generative AI, blockchain, and quantum computing, and their transformative impacts on industries.

I'm looking forward to exchanging insights and growing together. Thank you!
